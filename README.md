# pyvideoproc

Hey, this is my video processing repo.

Actually this is some part of the project I am building which is make Python(program) manage a YouTube channel. Basicly, Python will decide when to edit and edit recored videos and post them using AI and ML. This is the video porcessing part of the project. Honestly, I don't know how good I am, but I push my code whenever I improve it. Also I am an absolute beginner in documenting my code, so let me know if something is not understandable or wrong.

I am happy to get any feedback or help.

Thank you!
